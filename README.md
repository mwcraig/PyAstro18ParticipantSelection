Participant Selection for Python in Astronomy 2018
==================================================

The code in this repository contains a record of the details of
how we selected participants for Python in Astronomy 2018.

It can also serve as a tutorial for organizers of similar workshops.
Comments and suggestions are very welcome. Please get in touch via the
issues or contact the organizers via `python.in.astronomy.soc [at] gmail.com`.

This is would not exist without the efforts of the Python in Astronomy 2017
team, and the [description of the selection process that
year](https://github.com/marketplace), and the [entrofy
package](https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/entrofy) which makes this style of
selection possible.
